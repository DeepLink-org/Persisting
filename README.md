**Persistent infrastructure for the Agent era.**

Persisting connects durable model state—parameters and KV caches—with durable
Agent history—trajectories and execution records. The current product is the
path from execution to queryable history:

- **`pvisor`** is an executor that produces persistable, reviewable facts:
  staged Effects and execution records from one Agent Run;
- **`pchronicle`** browses, queries, exchanges, and serves trajectory Datasets.

Each command works on its own. Connected, they cover `pvisor run --safe` →
review/apply → configured capture → a queryable Dataset.

## Install

```bash
pip install persisting[lance]
pvisor --version
pchronicle --version
```

The rolling nightly build installs the same commands without a Rust toolchain:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeepLink-org/Persisting/main/scripts/install-nightly.sh | bash
```

See the [installation guide](https://deeplink-org.github.io/Persisting/installation/)
for platform requirements and executor setup.

## Run one Agent and review its changes

```bash
pvisor run --safe codex
pvisor review last
pvisor apply last --all   # or: pvisor drop last
```

`--safe` stages workspace changes; nothing enters your project tree before you
accept it. The exact boundary is platform-dependent and recorded with the
Run—consult the [execution guide](https://deeplink-org.github.io/Persisting/pvisor/guides/execution/)
before treating it as a security boundary.

## Query Agent trajectory history

```bash
pchronicle onboard
pchronicle onboard query
pchronicle agent codex ./trajectory-data --ask "Which tools fail most often?"
```

The onboarding flow creates a temporary example Dataset—no source checkout
required. `pchronicle import` accepts ATIF, ACTF, and OpenAI Messages;
`pchronicle serve` starts a loopback-only, read-only Dataset UI and API.

After capture is configured, selected pVisor Run events can enter a pChronicle
Dataset. See the [capture guide](https://deeplink-org.github.io/Persisting/pvisor/guides/capture/).

## Current maturity

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| pVisor host execution, review, checkpoints, and transactional workspace | Implemented |
| pChronicle local/S3 catalog, bounded SQL, analysis, find, import/export | Implemented |
| pChronicle loopback-only read API and embedded Web UI | Implemented |
| Gateway capture and cooperative proxy policy | Implemented |
| Container/libkrun executors and transparent network boundaries | Platform-dependent; see the pVisor and OverlayNet docs |
| Queue and document Search | Separate stable capabilities |
| Tensor Memory / TTAS | Experimental |
